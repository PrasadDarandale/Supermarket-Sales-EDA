# Supermarket Sales EDA

##  Project Overview

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a **Supermarket Sales** dataset with the objective of understanding sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and product-level trends in a retail environment.

The analysis converts raw transactional data into meaningful business insights by exploring relationships between sales, branches, product lines, customer types, payment methods, and time-based factors. This project is built as a **portfolio-ready internship project**, focusing on clarity, real-world relevance, and data-driven storytelling.

##  Objectives

* Understand the structure and quality of the supermarket sales data
* Analyze sales distribution across branches and product categories
* Study customer behavior based on gender, customer type, and payment method
* Identify trends across time (daily, monthly, and overall sales patterns)
* Generate insights useful for retail decision-making

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

##  Key Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Understanding

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Reviewed column names, data types, and dataset shape

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Checked for missing and duplicate values
* Ensured correct data formats for analysis

### 3. Univariate Analysis

* Distribution of sales, quantity, ratings, and gross income
* Analysis of individual categorical features

### 4. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

* Sales comparison across branches and product lines
* Customer type vs total sales analysis
* Payment method impact on sales
* Correlation analysis between numerical variables

### 5. Data Visualization

* Bar charts for categorical comparisons
* Histograms for numerical distributions
* Box plots to detect variability and outliers
* Heatmaps to visualize correlations

## Key Insights

* Certain product lines contribute significantly more to total sales
* Sales patterns vary across branches and customer types
* Payment methods show distinct usage trends among customers
* Time-based analysis reveals peak sales periods

*(Detailed visualizations and explanations are available in the notebook.)*
